# GRIPS Requirements Q&A Session 0.0.2

**Phase**: 0.0 (Prototype)
**Date Started**: 2026-01-06
**Participants**: Dunkaroo Destroyer (Agent), Floppy Dog (Human)
**Purpose**: Refine GRIPS methodology based on comparison with VocabReader methodology

---

## Question 1
**Asked by**: Dunkaroo Destroyer

**Question**: Should GRIPS incorporate sub-stages (A, B, C, D, E) within phases to provide more granular structure?

**VocabReader uses**: Foundation (A) → Core Features (B) → Integration (C) → Refinement (D) → Validation (E) stages within each phase
**GRIPS uses**: Just phases (0.0 prototype, 1.0 MVP, 2.0+ expansion)

Should GRIPS incorporate sub-stages within phases, or is the implementation plan's step-by-step breakdown sufficient?

**Answer**: VocabReader's sub-stages (Foundation, Core Features, Integration, Refinement, Validation) are project-specific and not relevant to the general GRIPS methodology. However, GRIPS does need to clearly define the stages/sub-stages that are part of its own workflow:

**For each spec layer** (requirements, design, implementation-plan):
1. Q&A stage
2. Draft stage
3. Review cycle(s) stage

**For implementation itself**:
- Separate workflow for executing implementation plan steps

These GRIPS-specific stages should be clearly documented in the methodology. Projects can define their own domain-specific sub-stages within phases if needed, but GRIPS shouldn't prescribe them.

## Question 2
**Asked by**: Dunkaroo Destroyer

**Question**: Should GRIPS formalize "approval gates" as explicit checkpoints that must be passed before proceeding?

**VocabReader uses**: Explicit approval gates between requirements → design → implementation → testing → release
**GRIPS uses**: Review cycles with approval, but not formalized as "gates"

Should GRIPS formalize "approval gates" as explicit checkpoints, or is the current "review until approved" approach sufficient?

**Answer**: We can call it a "gate" but this differentiation is trivial. GRIPS already has the concept - review cycles must complete with approval before proceeding to the next layer. Using the term "approval gate" is fine but doesn't change the substance. The current approach is sufficient; we can optionally use "gate" terminology for clarity.

---

## Question 3
**Asked by**: Dunkaroo Destroyer

**Question**: Should GRIPS reference specific standards like ISO 29148 for requirements, or remain standard-agnostic to be more flexible across different domains?

**VocabReader explicitly**: References ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 for requirements engineering
**GRIPS mentions**: "Industry standards" but doesn't cite specific standards

**Answer**: Leave out specific references to ISO standards. GRIPS should remain standard-agnostic to be flexible across different domains and project types. Projects can choose to follow specific standards like ISO 29148 if appropriate for their domain, but GRIPS doesn't mandate it.

## Question 4
**Asked by**: Dunkaroo Destroyer

**Question**: Should GRIPS include a terminology glossary section to ensure consistent understanding of terms across projects?

**VocabReader includes**: Explicit glossary defining Phase, Stage, Step, Milestone, Checkpoint, etc.
**GRIPS lacks**: Formal glossary

**Answer**: Yes, GRIPS should include a terminology glossary section to ensure consistent understanding of terms across projects.

---

## Question 5
**Asked by**: Dunkaroo Destroyer

**Question**: Should GRIPS recommend (or require) a separate PROJECT-STATUS.md file, or is inline status tracking in implementation plans sufficient?

**VocabReader uses**: PROJECT-STATUS.md for tracking milestones
**GRIPS uses**: Inline status in implementation plan steps

You mentioned earlier that status should be "single source of truth" - does that mean one file, or just not duplicated?

**Answer**: "Single source of truth" means not duplicated - each piece of status information should have exactly one authoritative location. However, we need multiple levels of status tracking:

1. **Project/Phase-level status** (e.g., PROJECT-STATUS.md or similar):
   - Current phase (0.0, 1.0, etc.)
   - Current stage within phase (Q&A, Draft, Review, Implementation)
   - What's currently being worked on
   - What's next
   - Layer synchronization status (e.g., "requirements updated in commit abc123 but design not yet synced")

2. **Implementation step status** (inline in implementation plan files):
   - Step completion status (✅ Complete, ⏳ In Progress, ⭕ Not Started)

GRIPS should recommend (or require) a project-level status document that tracks where we are in the overall process and what needs to be synchronized across layers. This is different from the granular step-by-step status in implementation plans.

## Question 6
**Asked by**: Dunkaroo Destroyer

**Question**: Are "checkpoints" and "verification checklists" the same concept with different names, or are VocabReader's checkpoints something different that GRIPS should incorporate?

**VocabReader uses**: "Checkpoints" within stages for verification points
**GRIPS uses**: "Verification checklists" in implementation plan steps

**Answer**: These are different concepts and both should be in GRIPS:

1. **Verification checklists**: Immediate verification after each implementation step
2. **Checkpoints**: Points in an implementation plan where additional verification is done that was postponed during individual step verification

Checkpoints handle verification that requires multiple steps to be complete first. Examples:
- Cross-platform or cross-device testing
- Performance testing across integrated features
- Integration testing after multiple components are built
- End-to-end testing scenarios

GRIPS should add checkpoints as aggregation points for broader verification beyond individual step checklists.

## Question 7
**Asked by**: Dunkaroo Destroyer

**Question**: Should GRIPS include explicit guidance on when and how to evolve the methodology itself? Should it include a revision history template?

**VocabReader includes**: Process evolution section + revision history table
**GRIPS has**: Version pinning but no guidance on how/when to evolve the methodology

**Answer**: Skipped for now - deferred to future consideration.

---

## Question 8
**Asked by**: Dunkaroo Destroyer

**Question**: Should GRIPS include a references section for standards, methodologies, and tools? Or should this be project-specific?

**VocabReader includes**: Standards, methodology resources, and tools sections
**GRIPS lacks**: References section

**Answer**: Skipped for now - deferred to future consideration.

---

## Question 9
**Asked by**: Dunkaroo Destroyer

**Question**: Should GRIPS be more prescriptive about development practices like TDD, or should it remain flexible and let projects define their own practices?

**VocabReader explicitly calls out**: TDD, code quality practices, pre-commit hooks
**GRIPS mentions**: Testing strategy in design layer but doesn't explicitly mandate practices like TDD

**Answer**: GRIPS should remain flexible and let projects define their own practices. Don't prescribe TDD or other specific development practices in GRIPS. Projects can document their chosen practices in their own methodology files or CLAUDE.md if desired.

(Note: In VocabReader, TDD is a myth - documented but not actually practiced)

---

## Question 10
**Asked by**: Dunkaroo Destroyer

**Question**: Should GRIPS be more flexible about review tools (allowing claude-review, GitHub PR comments, etc.) or is Critic Markup the preferred standard?

**VocabReader uses**: claude-review tool (browser-based inline comments)
**GRIPS specifies**: Critic Markup

**Answer**: Critic Markup only. GRIPS should standardize on Critic Markup as the review format to ensure consistency across projects and compatibility with markdown-based workflows.

## Current Understanding

### Key Decisions from Q&A

1. **Sub-stages**: GRIPS-specific workflow stages (Q&A → Draft → Review) should be clearly documented; project-specific sub-stages like VocabReader's Foundation/Core/Integration are not part of general GRIPS
2. **Approval gates**: Terminology is optional; concept already exists in GRIPS review cycles
3. **Standards references**: Remain standard-agnostic; no ISO references in GRIPS
4. **Glossary**: Add terminology glossary section to GRIPS
5. **Status tracking**: Two-level system needed:
   - Project/phase-level status document (PROJECT-STATUS.md or similar) for overall process and layer synchronization
   - Implementation step status (inline in implementation plans)
6. **Checkpoints**: Add checkpoints to GRIPS for aggregated verification beyond individual step checklists (cross-platform testing, integration testing, etc.)
7. **Methodology evolution**: Deferred to future consideration
8. **References section**: Deferred to future consideration
9. **Development practices**: Remain flexible; don't prescribe TDD or other specific practices
10. **Review tools**: Critic Markup only

### Updates Needed for methodology.md

Based on these decisions, the GRIPS methodology document needs:
- Clear documentation of workflow stages (Q&A → Draft → Review → Implementation)
- Terminology glossary section
- PROJECT-STATUS.md structure and requirements
- Checkpoint concept and format in implementation plans
- Optional "approval gate" terminology
