## Recent Activity
- Q&A 0.0.1: Complete (grips-methodology.md)
- Q&A 0.0.2: Complete (methodology-refinements.md)
- Q&A 0.0.3: ✅ Complete (implementation-plan-guidance.md)
- Commit 9c6322f: Completed 10 straightforward critical markup feedback items
- Commit 45a14f8: Added PROJECT-STATUS.md and resumability instructions
- New section 4.2: ✅ Drafted "Breaking Down Specs into Implementation Plans"
- Approval gate guidance: ✅ Expanded in section 5.1 Stage 4

## Outstanding Work

### 1. New Section: Breaking Down Specs into Prompt Steps
**Location**: Section 4.2 "Breaking Down Specs into Implementation Plans"
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Completed**: 2026-01-08
**Details**: Added comprehensive section 4.2 with 7 subsections covering:
  - 4.2.1: Step Granularity
  - 4.2.2: Step Structure and Format
  - 4.2.3: Research Phases
  - 4.2.4: Level of Detail in Tasks
  - 4.2.5: Organizing Steps into Stages
  - 4.2.6: Organizing Large Implementation Plans
  - 4.2.7: Step Ordering and Dependencies

### 2. Approval Gate Review Process
**Location**: Section 5.1 Stage 4 "Approval Gate"
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Completed**: 2026-01-08
**Details**: Expanded approval gate section with:
  - Agent responsibilities for critical review at gates
  - Gap analysis checklist
  - Example gate review
  - Explicit approval requirements
  - What gate reviews prevent

### 3. New Section: Agent Project Management and Phase Guidance
**Location**: Section 5.x or 6.x (TBD)
**Original Feedback**: "Add instructions about trying to railroad the human, or rather project manage the human, through the process. Suggest starting with a Q&A session, etc. Keep track of where in the process we are, including the current phase and stage. Always be aware of the current and next steps and try to encourage the human to follow the methodology. When something new comes up, whether it's an idea or a problem, try to guide the human through the process of breaking it into phases, selecting proper scope for each phase, helping them decide what to include, to minimize the size of each phase and maximize the value of each phase. I think we need a new section about this."
**Status**: Not started
**Next Steps**:
- Start Q&A 0.0.4 (Agent project management and phase guidance)
- Create new major section
- Add guidance on:
  - How agents should proactively guide humans through GRIPS workflow
  - Tracking current phase and stage
  - Suggesting next steps
  - Breaking down new ideas into appropriately-scoped phases
  - Encouraging adherence to methodology while remaining helpful

## Milestones
