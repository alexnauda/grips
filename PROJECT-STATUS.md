# Project Status

**Current Phase**: 0.0 (Prototype - GRIPS Methodology Development)
**Current Stage**: Requirements - Implementation
**Active Work**: Agent project management and phase guidance section

## Layer Synchronization
- Requirements (methodology.md): In progress
- Design: Not applicable (methodology is the product)
- Implementation Plan: Not applicable (methodology is the product)

## Recent Activity
- Q&A 0.0.1: Complete (grips-methodology.md)
- Q&A 0.0.2: Complete (methodology-refinements.md)
- Q&A 0.0.3: Complete (implementation-plan-guidance.md)
- Requirements approval gate: v0.0.1 passed

## Outstanding Work

### Agent Project Management Section
**What's Needed**: New methodology section on how agents guide humans through GRIPS
**Location**: Section 5.x or 6.x (TBD)
**Context**: Original critical markup feedback requested guidance on agent project management and phase guidance. The feedback stated: "Add instructions about trying to railroad the human, or rather project manage the human, through the process. Suggest starting with a Q&A session, etc. Keep track of where in the process we are, including the current phase and stage. Always be aware of the current and next steps and try to encourage the human to follow the methodology. When something new comes up, whether it's an idea or a problem, try to guide the human through the process of breaking it into phases, selecting proper scope for each phase, helping them decide what to include, to minimize the size of each phase and maximize the value of each phase."
**Tasks**:
- Conduct Q&A session 0.0.4 to explore agent project management patterns
- Draft new section covering:
  - How agents proactively guide humans through GRIPS workflow
  - Tracking current phase and stage
  - Suggesting next steps
  - Breaking down new ideas into appropriately-scoped phases
  - Encouraging adherence to methodology while remaining helpful

## Next Steps
1. Start Q&A 0.0.4 (Agent project management and phase guidance)
2. Draft new section on agent project management
3. Integrate section into methodology
4. Review for v0.0.2 approval gate
