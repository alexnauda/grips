# Project Status

**Current Phase**: 0.0 (Prototype - GRIPS Methodology Development)
**Current Stage**: Requirements - Feedback Integration
**Active Work**: Incorporating critical markup feedback into methodology.md

## Layer Synchronization
- Requirements (methodology.md): Partially updated (commit 9c6322f) - Outstanding work remains
- Design: Not applicable (methodology is the product)
- Implementation Plan: Not applicable (methodology is the product)

## Recent Activity
- Q&A 0.0.1: Complete (grips-methodology.md)
- Q&A 0.0.2: Complete (methodology-refinements.md)
- Methodology draft: In progress - incorporating feedback
- Commit 9c6322f: Completed 10 straightforward critical markup feedback items

## Outstanding Work

### 1. New Section: Breaking Down Specs into Prompt Steps
**Location**: Section 4.2 Implementation Plan Layer (around line 169)
**Original Feedback**: "We need another section about how to break down specs into prompt steps in an implementation plan. This is either an expansion of this section or a major new section. Let's do a Q&A on this and devise how to give this guidance in the methodology."
**Status**: Q&A session started (0.0.3-implementation-plan-guidance.md)
**Next Steps**:
- Complete Q&A session with Doctor Headquire
- Draft new section or expand existing section 4.2
- Add guidance on:
  - Appropriate granularity for steps
  - How to convert design specs to executable prompts
  - When to split or combine steps
  - How to structure verification checklists

### 2. New Section: Agent Project Management and Phase Guidance
**Location**: Section 5.1 Workflow Stages (around line 216)
**Original Feedback**: "Add instructions about trying to railroad the human, or rather project manage the human, through the process. Suggest starting with a Q&A session, etc. Keep track of where in the process we are, including the current phase and stage. Always be aware of the current and next steps and try to encourage the human to follow the methodology. When something new comes up, whether it's an idea or a problem, try to guide the human through the process of breaking it into phases, selecting proper scope for each phase, helping them decide what to include, to minimize the size of each phase and maximize the value of each phase. I think we need a new section about this."
**Status**: Not started
**Next Steps**:
- Start Q&A session after completing section 1 work
- Create new major section (possibly section 5.2 or separate section 6)
- Add guidance on:
  - How agents should proactively guide humans through GRIPS workflow
  - Tracking current phase and stage
  - Suggesting next steps
  - Breaking down new ideas into appropriately-scoped phases
  - Encouraging adherence to methodology while remaining helpful

## Next Steps
1. Update methodology to require PROJECT-STATUS.md maintenance
2. Complete Q&A 0.0.3 (Breaking down specs into prompt steps)
3. Draft and integrate new section on breaking down specs
4. Start Q&A 0.0.4 (Agent project management)
5. Draft and integrate new section on agent guidance
6. Final review of all changes
7. Pass requirements approval gate for methodology v0.0.1
